# All Pairs Shortest Paths

In the lectures, we've seen Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths
from a given vertex to all other vertices in the graph. We've also covered the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest path between all *pairs* of
vertices. It works as follows:

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ with weighted edges:
- initialize a $|V|\times|V|$ matrix `dist` to $\infty$
- for each vertex $v \in V$, `dist[v][v] = 0`
- for each edge $(u,v) = e \in E$, `dist[u][v] = weight((u,v))`
- for each vertex $k\in V$:
    - for each vertex $i\in V$:
        - for each vertex $j\in V$:
            - `if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:`
              `dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]`

Implement this algorithm, starting with the template I provided in `code.js`.
The function takes a weighted graph graph and returns the matrix with the
distances, as described above. You can choose any data structures you like for
the implementation.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case time complexity ($\Theta$) of the algorithm? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

FW Algorithm:

     ```javascript
     for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
         for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
             for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                 if (dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]) {
                     dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```
Each of the three loops runs $(V)$ times, leading to $(V \times V \times V = V^3)$ iterations.

So we have a time complexity of $\Theta(V^3)$.
